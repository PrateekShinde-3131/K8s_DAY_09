# Kubernetes Service and Deployment Example
This document provides instructions to create a Service and Deployment in Kubernetes, scale the deployment, and test it inside and outside the cluster.

## Step 1: Create a Service of Type `ClusterIP`
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP
  ```

# Kubernetes Service and Deployment Example

This document provides instructions to create a Service and Deployment in Kubernetes, scale the deployment, and test it inside and outside the cluster.

## Step 1: Create a Service of Type `ClusterIP`

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP
  ```
This creates a service named myapp of type ClusterIP that exposes port 80 and maps it to the target port 80.

## Step 2: Create a Deployment
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:1.23.4-alpine
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80

```
This Deployment creates 1 replica of an nginx:1.23.4-alpine container and exposes container port 80.

## Step 3: Scale the Deployment
```
kubectl scale deployment myapp --replicas=2
```
This command scales the myapp Deployment to 2 replicas.

## Step 4: Create a Temporary Pod Using busybox and Test the Service
Run a temporary busybox pod and run a wget command against the IP of the service.

```
kubectl run busybox --rm -it --image=busybox -- /bin/sh
```
Once inside the pod, run:

```
wget -qO- http://<service-ip>
```
To get the service IP, run:

```
kubectl get svc myapp -o wide
```
## Step 5: Test the Service Outside the Cluster
To test outside the cluster, you need to change the service type.

## Step 6: Change the Service Type to NodePort
Edit the service:
```
kubectl edit svc myapp
```
Change type: ClusterIP to:
```
type: NodePort
```
Alternatively, apply the following YAML:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 30007  # This can be any port in the range 30000-32767
  type: NodePort
```
## Step 7: Run wget Outside the Cluster
Get the IP of the node:
```
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```
Run:
```
wget -qO- http://<node-ip>:<node-port>
```
## Discussion

### Can You Expose Pods as a Service Without a Deployment?
Yes, you can expose individual Pods as a service without using a Deployment. However, using a Deployment is recommended because it provides scalability, self-healing, and rolling updates.

### When to Use Different Service Types?
 1. ClusterIP: 
    - Use case: For internal services, only accessible within the cluster.

2. NodePort:
    - Use case: Expose the service on each node at a static port. Good for small-scale services without a cloud load balancer.

3. LoadBalancer:
     - Use case: On cloud providers, to expose services externally through a load balancer.

4. ExternalName:
     - Use case: Map a service to an external DNS name, useful for external services accessed from within the cluster.
